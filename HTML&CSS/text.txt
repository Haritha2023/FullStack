              DNS - domain name system
                |
            IP address
    
    when we click on link, this DNS system will connect domain name to IP address, 
    these ip addresses are stored in some server, that are placed somewhere else in the world

    there are multiple nodes connected to each other 
    Multiple nodes are working to find the ip address is called ROUTING
    these nodes connected to servers

    we made request we got response

  9/10/2023 CSS-Position
  ----------------------
  The types of positioning in CSS are-
1)static: this is the default value.We cannot use top,bottom,left and right and
z-index value with static position.
2)relative: the element is positioned relative to its normal position.We can 
move relative element using top,bottom,left and right.
3)absolute: the element is positioned absolutely to its first positioned parent.
We can moved element and provide z-index. For example we position parent relative
and move child using absolute property.

An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned 
ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed).
however; if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it uses the 
document body, and moves along with page scrolling.
Note: Absolute positioned elements are removed from the normal flow, and can overlap 
elements.

4)fixed: the element is positioned related to the browser window.
5)sticky: the element is positioned based on the user's scroll position.After
element goes to scroll position it act as fixed and we give it using top,left,
right,bottom.
